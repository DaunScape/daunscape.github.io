# DaunScape üçÄ

DaunScape is a GitHub organization managed by [me](https://www.manoedinata.com). It is a place where I store some of my open source works, as well as private projects that are too precious to be stored in my personal repositories. :P

However, since it's an organization, anyone could willingly register to DaunScape, and contribute to any public repositories owned by DaunScape. Oh, don't forget the `@daunscape.tech` email domain!
